The following reusable constructs are currently included:

1.  GuardedMap - Type that can be applied to a standar Map that adds type guard narrowing to Map.has(key:K)
2.  ErrorNormalizingWrapper - Error wrapper that normalizes javascript error objects so that they can be handled consistently regardless of their type
